                    <p>An Evanston man has quit the business world to follow his dreams, picking up his guitar and trying to break into the music business.<br></br>
                        You could call Bruce Holmes a Renaissance man. He has done just about everything in his life, from martial arts to coaching chess and from authoring a novel to designing software.<br></br>
                        In 2001, however, Holmes said he underwent a "year of changes."<br></br>
                        That year his mother died, his wife divorced him and his software company crumbled.<br></br>
                        So the 56-year-old decided to become a singer-songwriter, building his own recording studio in his home.<br></br>
                        "It's what I've always wanted to do. So I decided, 'Life is too short,'" he said.<br></br>
                        A music lover and guitar player for his entire life, Holmes is taking on the new venture after 18 years as a business owner.<br></br>
                        After having trouble with his knees as a high school runner, Holmes began to study the Feldenkrais method of body awareness. Eventually, he made a set of tapes teaching the method and sought out to sell them.<br></br>
                        In the process, Holmes designed a software program to help manage the mail-order business. He soon started selling the program, Mail Order Wizard, gaining a set of loyal customers. He named his venture the Haven Corp.<br></br>
                        "It was just, 'Bingo!' and I had a business going," Holmes said.</p>
                    <h4>Sci-Fi Novelist</h4>
                    <p> Soon after he started the business, Holmes also wrote a science fiction novel, "Anvil of the Heart." It was well-accepted by the writing world, gaining status on the Locus recommended reading list for 1984 and spending time in the running for a Nebula nomination for best novel.<br></br>
                        But by the mid1990s, the software company was failing to keep up with the competitive market.<br></br>
                        I went through about six years of hard times," Holmes said.<br></br>
                        In 2001, the 26-member company collapsed and the business was taken over by a competitor.<br></br>
                        So, Holmes decided to try something new, beginning to write and record song in his own home recording studio.<br></br>
                        "It's the hardest thing I've ever tried to do," he said.<br></br>
                        Holmes records all of the music himself, recording instruments separately and putting them together into his own masterpieces.<br></br>
                        "I didn't believe that people could do this for real," Holmes said, "but if I do it myself, at least I know I'll like it. There's something to be said for doing things yourself."</p>
                    <h4>Not A Quick Task</h4>
                    <p>Songs usually take Holmes months to write, and a bit longer to record, he said.<br></br>
                        "When I hear about someone writing a song in 15 minutes, I want to ring their neck," Holmes joked. "It doesn't happen for me."<br></br>
                        A storyteller at heart, Holmes said he writes "dozens of pages" of lyrics before he arranges a final song. "Most of it gets thrown away," he said.<br></br>
                        But it's worth the work, he said.<br></br>
                        "The biggest high I ever have in my life, the most thrilling moment I ever have in my life, is when a song is coming together," he said. "It's euphoria. It's bliss."<br></br>
                        And, he added, he is always writing.<br></br>
                        "There is a part of my brain that's working on stuff all of the time," he said. "I always have a notepad around in case I have a good idea. If you don't catch the little flashes of inspiration you really lose a lot."<br></br>
                        He said he's taking one day at a time, experimenting with new instruments and recording.<br></br>
                        "I don't know what I'm doing yet," he said. "I'm just trying to learn."<br></br>
                        Holmes sends samples of his music to local clubs and bars, getting the opportunity to play in the Chicago area.<br></br>
                        A father of three, he has even played duets with his sixth-grade daughter, who plays the fiddle.<br></br>
                        "She's much better than I am," he quipped.<br></br>
                        As for stage fright, Holmes is working on that, too. The challenge, he said, is playing in a noisy venu where not everyone is interested.<br></br>
                        "Sometimes you're thinking to yourself, 'Why am I doing this? No one is paying attention,'" he said. "Most people weren't listening - but somebody was."<br></br>
                        He said that often people stop him after shows to chat with him about his music.<br></br>
                        "There is nothing in the world that is as wonderful as having an audience that's listening, and to play songs that you've written," he said.<br></br>
                        Holmes said he is happier now than he has been in years because he is doing what he loves, and he's trying to put tough times behind him.<br></br>
                        "I'm just taking stock, trying to find the good in it," he said.<br></br>
                        "I'm happy. Sometimes I'm pinching myself lately!"</p>
