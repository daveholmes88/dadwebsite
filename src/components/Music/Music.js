                                    “Shine” is one of the best summaries concerning what's really meaningful in life that I have ever heard expressed in a song.

                                    Already a fan, I brought two friends along to Bruce’s show.
                                    They were totally entertained, by Bruce’s fine singing and excellent instrumental work,
                                    but more so by the unique repertoire, which includes some provocative material, delivered in a heartfelt and honest manner. Bruce is engaging, connects with his audience, and is an original in spirit and in song!
