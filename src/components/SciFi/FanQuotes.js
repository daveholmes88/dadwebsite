                            I just wanted to take a moment to thank you once again. I just finished my annual reading of Anvil of the Heart. I first bought a paper back copy of your book in 1984. 24 years later I still glean something new from it every time I read it. More times then I care to admit I find myself quoting Rafferty or John. As I grow older, I am 44 now, things I learned from your wisdom years ago have changed and grown, and what I did not understand then has become all too clear now. So I say now, in fear of appearing to ramble on, thank you. To date you are my greatest sensei.
                            <br></br>Forever grateful, your friend,
                        </span><br></br>

                            I just wanted to tell you that I read Anvil of the Heart a couple of years ago at the request of a good friend of mine. The story you told was life altering to say the least. It has completely changed the way I look at life and deal with people and situations. I'm sure you hear this all the time but I wanted to tell you for myself. I have recommended your book to many of my friends and I have in fact purchased an extra signed copy as a gift for a close friend of mine who I think can learn from the valuable lesson provided in Anvil of the Heart. So thank you again for such a wonderful story and a wonderful way to look at life.
                            <br></br>With Sincere Appreciation,
                        </span><br></br>

                            I Just finished Anvil of the Heart again. I started it over the weekend and I was pulled through to the end, unable to stop. It's so inspiring, joyous, and heartbreakingly beautiful. I cannot thank you enough.

                            I was going through a box of old books and came across my copy of Anvil of the Heart and so I started to read it again.  I have read it maybe 5 or 6 times in the last 20 or so years, and every time I do, I am amazed by how good it is.  Maybe my memory is just that bad, but I doubt it.
                            What a wonderful book.  I look forward to giving it to my son and daughter to read in a couple of years (they are 8 and 6).
                            Thank you for such a wonderful story that does not seem to age.  It is as fresh now as it was then and even more relevant.  Thank you.

                            I bought your book when it first came out, back in the 1980's, and it has always been one of my favorite books, as much for the human drama as for the sci-fi element.  I probably read it 3 or 4 times before I moved to Mannheim, Germany in 1996 and sold my whole book collection to several used book dealers in New Orleans - about 2,500 books - 17 bookcases full.
                            I'm 54 now, living in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and trying to track down some of my old favorites, all of which are long out of print, of course. Strangely enough, most of my favorites seem to be from author's who only wrote one book and never continued. I can't tell you how often I've wondered why you, in particular, never came out with another book. Was it too much work for the monetary reward? I've been to your website, and I see that you seem to have a musical career, so perhaps music was always your first, best love.
                            In any case, I am truly thrilled to have found another copy of Anvil of the Heart after so many years, and thrilled too to have had a chance to tell the author himself how much I have enjoyed his book.
                            <br></br>Regards,
                        </span><br></br>

                            I picked up Anvil of the Heart when I was 17 yrs old. I bought it from a softcover rack at a Safeway store. That was in 1987. The book has lived in the back of my mind since that day. I recognized my own frustrations and aspirations in John. It was a work of truth. The lessons you offered followed me. Thank you.

                            Thanks very much indeed for your email and the copy of Master of the Guard. Ever since first reading Anvil of the Heart as a teen in the 80's I hoped that you would write more. Anvil of the Heart is one of my all time favourite novels. It inspired me when I first read it and it still inspires me today. My copy sits alongside the likes of Dune, Lord of the Rings, Musashi and Moby Dick, amongst other life-long favourites. It is an awsome novel and entirely at home there. I cannot possibly thank you enough for your writing, which has been thought-provoking, inspirational, emotional and tremendously enjoyable. Thanks again,
                        </span><br></br>
