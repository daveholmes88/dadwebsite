                            From the first paragraph to the last, Anvil of the Heart was difficult to put down. It is a truly extraordinary book.

                            I have no hesitation in expressing enormous enthusiasm for Anvil of the Heart. It is, as British reviewers always seem to say, a "jolly good read," and, I think, a real find. The strength of the book, besides the fact that it is constantly exciting to read, lies in a cast of complex and consistently interesting characters with more depth than most science fiction novels, and a precise attention to the details of psychology, especially as it pertains to Aikido. There are many powerful and moving scenes in the book. I congratulate Bruce Holmes on a terrific first novel.

                            Anvil of the Heart is written with zanshin. Well-executed, it has color, action, thought and feeling--a first book which makes one eager to read the author's second. Mr. Holmes is a writer to watch.

                            I found this to be one of the most absorbing books I've had in hand for some time. I glance at the first page upon opening the package...and couldn't stop for four pages. I finished the book that night, after doing my own stint of writing, and even while writing I found myself thinking about it. It is a story that stays with you, makes you think, makes you care about the characters portrayed. My family, at the moment, numbers three who are at home, and we all have read and raved over Anvil. This is a book that changes the reader.

                            Anvil of the Heart is the kind of book one comes on far too infrequently. It creates a believable and engrossing reality, peopled with characters who leap off the page with life. Holmes writes with particular authority on Aikido, weaving it into his story adroitly and conveying the philosophy effectively. What a joy to encounter an author with something to say and the ability to say it entertainingly.

                            Bruce Holmes in an impressive first novel has managed the unlikely blend of the classic science fiction theme of revolt against tyranny with a martial arts subplot. His characters are well-realized and his action sequences as breathless as they come.

                            Holmes's future society has a frightening authenticity. The 'villains' are ourselves, really, our own technology having released our potential for evil in the form of humanity's classic failing, presumed superiority. The 'heroes' fall into the gray area as well. Real and solid people doing what they must, with some well-done and intriguing philosophy growing naturally out of their conflicts.

                            I have read Anvil of the Heart and I must say it is a novel hard to put down once started There is a freshness about Bruce T. Holmes's novel, an ingenuousness not often seen in current science fiction. He knows how to tell a good story. That is important these days, for there are becoming fewer good story-tellers.

                            I was enthralled all the way through the book, and I was delighted with the way he handled the interweaving of action and story. This is a beautifully executed novel, and I see no reason that Bruce T. Holmes should not soon take his place among the best of all the selling sf authors. This book has all the hallmarks I look for in good entertainment. It has solid characters, strong point of view, and a tantalizing philosophical theme exemplified within the events rather than in author's polemics.

                            Anvil of the Heart had me hooked from the beginning. If nothing else, Mr. Holmes knows how to tell an engaging story. But there is something else. He has characters who change, who grow through overcoming the inner conflicts of their own personalities, or who fall as victims of those conflicts. In the process of doing this, he gives us a story that works or many different levels and in different contexts.

                            A remarkably satisfying book. Holmes has the knack for putting you into his situations, not just describing them to you. And his ideas are thoughtful: all too often science fiction is relatively shallow once the veil of technology has been lifted.

                            What the near future will actually be like no one now living can possibly know or even predict with a reasonable likelihood of success. Aldous Huxley made one guess, Orwell another. Now 1984 is practically here, and not more than about one-tenth of the latter's direst predictions have come true. We can at least be grateful for that, and go right on reading with the keenest kind of enjoyment books of this nature, particularly when they are powerful enough to curdle our spines and lift us from our seats, along with no small measure of intellectual enrichment. All of this Bruce Holmes has achieved in Anvil of the Heart, an exceptionally brilliant first novel.

                            Before my eyes, John Cunningham became a three-dimensional figure in a yarn that builds to an apocalyptic climax. It's an ambitious work that reaches black-belt status. I'd put Anvil of the Heart near Heinlein's Friday--and this his first time out!

                            Anvil of the Heart is a superior novel--a powerful statement and a great adventure story. Holmes displays high affinity with his characters, and I found myself caring very much about what would happen to them next. This goes well beyond the results of suspense techniques. He also handles story situations with clarity and reality. The result is vividness without kinkiness. Anvil turns out to be a convincing story of human victory. There is even a certain joy in it. Unlike a lot of authors, Holmes hasn't given up on man.

                            I intended to sample the book by reading the first chapter immediately after opening the package; instead, I went on reading straight to the end of the book. It's an impressive, stirring story--certainly an outstanding first novel. The author's love for Aikido burns like a flame, imbuing the story with a power that partakes of both stillness and strength. I only wish it had been longer; I hated to see the story end.

Bruce Holmes has proven with this first novel that he's an author worth watching for in the future. He has the three strengths that are necessary for a good novelist: strong plots, characters that the reader can care about, and an underlying resonance that remains once the book has been finished. What more can one ask for? Thanks for a good read, Bruce.
